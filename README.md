# COVID19 Data Analysis using Python

**`Project on Analyzing the Relationship between COVID19 Spread and Happiness Levels`**

This repository contains the project "COVID19 Data Analysis using Python" which focused on data analysis, data preparation, and data visualization using Python. The main objective of the project was to analyze the relationship between the spread of the COVID19 virus and the happiness levels of people living in different countries.

The COVID19 dataset, sourced from John Hopkins University, provides cumulative daily counts of confirmed cases in each country. Additionally, we have another dataset that captures various life factors, as rated by individuals residing in countries worldwide.



### Project Objectives
The project aimed to achieve the following learning objectives:

1. Learn the steps needed to prepare data sources for analysis.
2. Identify and calculate appropriate measures for analysis based on the data.
3. Visualize the results of the analysis.

By the end of the project, I gained knowledge and skills in preprocessing and merging datasets, calculating relevant measures, and preparing data for analysis.
